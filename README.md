This project is a code challenge from [NoRedInk](http://noredink.com/), a two hour project as the first part of them deciding whether to interview me further for becoming part of their team.

Use `elm-reactor` to run the example:

    cd ...
    git clone git@github.com:billstclair/NoRedInkChallengeWws.git

    cd .../NoRedInkChallengeWws
    elm reactor
    
Then aim your browser at http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm

During development, you can test a compile with the `m` script:

    cd .../NoRedInkChallengeWws
    bin/m Main

This creates no output file, but reports on compilation errors.
